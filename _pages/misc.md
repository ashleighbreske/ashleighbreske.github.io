## Mostly useless

I am addicted to traveling solo. Kyrgyzstan is my favorite destination, by far.
 
I don't often browse the Internet, but when I do, I [quora](http://www.quora.com/Ke-Tran) or [arxiv](http://arxiv.org/list/cs.LG/recent).

I like [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/ketran). I'm into sci-fi, non-fiction and [poetry](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596363/quotes?item=qt2743153).
 
I speak a little [Sindarin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindarin).


## Notes

I wrote some technical notes during my spare time.

[Variational Inference]({{ site.url }}/notes/vb.pdf)

[Noise Contrastive Estimation]({{ site.url }}/notes/nce.pdf) (for unnormalized distribution - use in training neural network, typically probabilistic neural language models.)
