I am a PhD candidate at [Urban Affairs and Planning department](http://uap.vt.edu/), Virginia Tech, specializing in travel behavior, activity - travel, and choice modeling. My research focuses on the choice mechanism for sustainable travel modes, travel satisfaction and well-being.

Before pursuing graduate studies, I worked as an urban planner and research assistant at the National Institute of Urban and Rural Planning in Vietnam for two years. I completed an MS degree in Urban and Regional Planning from the University of Iowa, and a BEng degree in Urban Construction Management from Hanoi Architectural University.
