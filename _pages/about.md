I am a PhD candidate at [Informatics Institute](http://ivi.uva.nl/) / [Information and Language Processing Systems](http://ilps.science.uva.nl/), University of Amsterdam.
I am working on Statistical Machine Translation, advised by [Christof Monz](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/c.monz/) and [Arianna Bisazza](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.bisazza/).

I am interested in representation learning and [probabilistic programing](http://probabilistic-programming.org). I spend most of my time with [Torch7](http://torch.ch) ([Lua](http://www.lua.org)). Just for fun, I program in [Ocaml](http://ocaml.org), [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) and ~~[Julia](http://julialang.org)~~ [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) sometimes.

Before starting my PhD, I completed my master, [EMLCT](http://lct-master.org/), in computational linguistics at University of Groningen and Charles University in Prague. [Marco Wiering](http://www.ai.rug.nl/~mwiering/) and [Daniel Zeman](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/daniel-zeman) were my master thesis supervisors.
