I am an Assistant Professor of Urban Sustainability in the Department of Geography and the Sustainability Institute at The Ohio State University. My research focuses on transport and energy demand, physical and mental health, and data analytics. 

My dissertation _Emotional Agents: Modeling Satisfaction, Affinity, and Travel Demand Using a Smartphone Travel Survey_ quantifies the effects of travel satisfaction and travel-liking attitude on travel demand (e.g., mode choice, trip frequency, travel time) and overall subjective well-being. The data were collected using a smartphone-based travel survey with a multiday activity-travel diary and GPS tracking with high spatio-temporal resolutions. I have also studied the environmental health impacts of non-auto transport (e.g., walking, bicycling, and transit), both in terms of physical and mental health.

Prior to pursuing my graduate studies, I worked as an urban planner and researcher at the National Institute for Urban and Rural Planning (Vietnam Ministry of Construction) in Vietnam for two years. I obtained a Ph.D. in Planning from Virginia Tech, an M.S. in Urban and Regional Planning from the University of Iowa, and a B.Eng. in Urban Construction Management from Hanoi Architectural University, Vietnam.
