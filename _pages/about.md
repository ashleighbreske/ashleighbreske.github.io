I am a PhD candidate at [Urban Affairs and Planning](https://www.spia.vt.edu/uap/), Virginia Tech, specializing in travel behavior, physical and mental health, activity - travel, and choice modeling. My dissertation _Emotional Agents: Modeling Satisfaction, Affinity, and Travel Demand Using a Smartphone Travel Survey_ focuses on how travel satisfaction and affinity relate to travel demand (e.g., mode choice, trip rate) and overall subjective well-being. 

Before pursuing my graduate studies, I worked as an urban planner and research assistant at the National Institute for Urban and Rural Planning in Vietnam for two years. I completed an MS degree in Urban and Regional Planning from the University of Iowa, and a BEng degree in Urban Construction Management from Hanoi Architectural University.
