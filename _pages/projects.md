### Current Research

(Updated April 2017)

## 8. National scale direct demand model of pedestrian and bicycle traffic

We use NBPDP data and other count data obtained from local agencies to model peak-period bicycle and pedestrian traffic at the national level. This will enhance the generalizability and transferability of the existing direct-demand models. The final models will aid communities with few or no non-motorized traffic counts in selecting suitable sites to invest bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure.

## 7. Mood state in transport environments

This study explores the effect of the built environment, attitude, and perceptions on mode choice using the theoretical background in psychology and behavioral economics. I look to apply the hybrid choice modeling, an extension of the traditional discrete choice, to incorporate the psychological factors into mode choice models.
Past Projects

## 6. Spatial analysis of non-motorized crash on the street network: A case study in Northern Virginia

This study aims explore a regional scale of crashes involving pedestrian and bicycle. It provides insight on how crash locations are clustered on the spatial dimension, and how it affects other non-automobile users such as transit riders who bike or walk to access transit stops. The study helps promote active transportation and car-independence lifestyle as safety is among the biggest factors for people to choose to bike and walk.

Using kernel density analysis, hotspot analysis, as well as network analysis, we found a strong spatial correlation of crash spots that involved with pedestrians and cyclists at a distance from 200m to 2000m. We also found that more severe crashes happened at midblock than at intersections. The crash patterns coincide with built environment factors, such as population, job, and housing unit density. These are also activity centers, which attract high traffic (high AADT). Finally, using these above results, we calculated severity index at affected transit stops and identified 15 transit stops that have severity indices above 10.

## 5. Spatiotemporal Patterns of Transit Accessibility on Predicting the Transit Use of Residents in the Catchment Area: A study of the Exposition Light Rail Line in Los Angeles, CA (Master’s Major Research Project)

Abstract

This study proposes a way to measure spatiotemporal accessibility, as well as examines its impact, along with other transit attributes and built environment characteristics, on transit use of residents who live within the transit catchment area. We used the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data, the Longitudinal Employment and Household Data 2011, and the longitudinal Neighborhood Activity and Travel Survey (N = 1,757) from the neighborhoods along the newly-opened Exposition light rail line in Los Angeles, CA from 2011 to 2013. We employed network analysis to measure job accessibility by transit, then built four sets of logistic regression models to assess the likelihood of using transit.

## 4. Sioux City Active Transportation (Master’s capstone project)

Together with four other graduate students, I created an active transportation plan for Sioux City, IA as part of Blue Zone designation process. This plan includes bike and pedestrian components using 5Es framework (Engineering, Encouragement, Education, Enforcement, and Evaluation). It ensures high benefits for users while keeping the infrastructure cost affordable.

The plan was featured at National APA Conference 2015 and Iowa APA Conference 2015, and was adopted by Sioux City Council in September 2015.

## 3. Impact of Fuel Tax on Vehicle Miles Traveled: Evidence from the National Household Travel Survey 2001 – 2009

The study used the National Household Travel Survey 2001 and 2009 and the gas & diesel tax data (Federal Highway Administration) and difference-in-differences method to examine the impact of fuel tax increase on household VMT at the national level.

## 2. Bus Quality of Service Analysis: A Case Study in Iowa City Metropolitan Area (Conference Poster, Report to be updated)
Quality of transit service is essential for maintaining the equity of mobility for low income people and the elderly. It is also important for attracting choice riders to reduce both operating costs and emissions.

This study examines the quality of service in Iowa City metropolitan area from economic and social standpoints. Our questions are, whether the service serves both captive and choice riders well, and how we can improve the operation to increase the ridership. We applied and extended the methods covered in Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual (TCRP Report 165).
